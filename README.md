# MIT 6.S191 Course

This repository contains the labs of [MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning Course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/). 
The course is very helpful to understand and clarify concepts about Deep Learning,
and provides excellent labs to practice what I learn during the classes.

## Course Description

According the official page of MIT 6.S191, the course description is the follow:
> MIT's introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, 
natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge 
of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. 
Course concludes with a project proposal competition with feedback from staff and panel of industry sponsors.
Prerequisites assume calculus (i.e. taking derivatives) and linear algebra (i.e. matrix multiplication), 
we'll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is helpful but not necessary. 
This class is taught during MIT's IAP term by current MIT PhD researchers. Listeners are welcome!
